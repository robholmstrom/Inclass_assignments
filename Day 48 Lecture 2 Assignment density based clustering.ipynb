Some tips that may be helpful:\n","\n","1. Unlike our approach for hierarchical clustering, we do not need to calculate the NxN distance matrix for DBSCAN upfront. It directly supports the haversine distance metric, provided the nearest-neighbors algorithm is a ball tree. Set the \"algorithm\" and \"metric\" parameters to the appropriate values. \n","2. Scikit-learn's implementation of haversine distance expects radians instead of degrees. Therefore, it would be advisable to create two new columns, Lat_Rad and Lon_Rad, that convert the Latitude and Longitude columns into radians. (Hint: there is a numpy function that does this.)  \n","3. The eps parameter, which corresponds to the radius of the neighborhood, will also need to be in radians. The conversion factor for miles to radians is approximately 1/3958.748; in other words, if you want the neighborhood to have a radius of 3 miles, set eps = 3/3958.748.  \n","\n","Side note: ball-tree is an indexing structure that is very useful for nearest-neighbor calculations. The general time-complexity of finding a nearest neighbor using a Ball Tree is O(nlog(n)). This is a vast improvement over the naive O($n^{2}$) and allows us to cluster on much larger subsets of the data, like the entire country. Scikit-learn directly supports creating ball-trees through sklearn.neighbors.BallTree; if inclined, you could extend the analysis in the first after-lecture assignment (in which we calculated a similarity matrix for Hawaii) to the entire country using a BallTree and identify \"island Starbucks locations\" on a much larger scale.\n","\n","Additionally, save the predicted cluster assignments
